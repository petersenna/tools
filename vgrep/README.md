# vgrep

vgrep is a Python script to grep for strings in a given source tree.  It is
mainly inspired by cgvg, but faster by making use of 'git grep'.

##Usage Example:

###Grep for a symbol
You can grep for all occurences of a specified string 'FOO' in your current
directory by passing 'FOO' to vgrep.  vgrep prints the occurences in the
format "Index  Source File  Source Line  Content".  The index can later be used
to open a specific location in an editor.  vgrep caches the last call, so that
you can re-open your previous call by simply calling vgrep without arguments.

Note that vgrep pipes the output to 'less' for more than 100 indexes.

```
[~/linux/kernel/irq]$ vgrep request_irq
Index  Source File  Source Line  Content

0      devres.c     129          *  free IRQs allocated with devm_request_irq().
1      manage.c     1391         *  free_irq - free an interrupt allocated with request_irq
2      manage.c     1572         ret = request_irq(irq, handler, flags, name, dev_id);
3      manage.c     483          KERN_ERR "enable_irq before setup/request_irq: irq %u\n", irq))
4      manage.c     559          int can_request_irq(unsigned int irq, unsigned long irqflags)
```

###Show indexed location
To visit a specific location we can use '--show' and the corresponding index.
vgrep will then open the location with the editor set in your enviroment.  If
no editor is set, vgrep defaults to vim.

```
[~/linux/kernel/irq]$ vgrep --show 3
```
